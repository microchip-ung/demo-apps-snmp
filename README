This module shall be placed under vtss_appl, i.e., vtss_appl/demo_snmp/
 $ cd .../vtss_appl
 $ git clone git@github.com:microchip/demo-apps-snmp demo_snmp
 $ cd demo_snmp
 $ git checkout 4.6

Preparation:
------------
Goto the build directory. If you have not already setup a link 'config.mk', then run
'make' which will provide you with a list of posibilities. Choose one, e.g.,
 $ tools/set_build_config.rb -c configs/istax_multi.mk -s istax_jr2_24

To make life easy, generate tags, i.e., 'make TAGS'. Then you have tags for the emacs
editor. That will be useful in the following.


Build application:
-------------------------
(Note: The patch 'patch-snmp.patch' contain the changes that need to be done
in the 4.6 WebStaX file tree (item 2,3,4 below). The changes are described below,
but if it is unclear what is done, then look in this patch file - alternatively
simply apply it, which is done with
 $ cd <webstax-root>
 $ patch -p1 < vtss_appl/demo_snmp/patch-snmp.patch
)

1) cp module_demo_snmp.in ../../build/make/module_demo_snmp.in

2) If the line 'Custom/AddModules =' does not exist in config.mk, then add the line
'Custom/AddModules = demo_snmp'. If it does exist, then add 'demo_snmp' to the end of the
space seperated list, e.g., 'Custom/AddModules = xxx yyy demo_snmp'

3) Add VTSS_MODULE_ID_DEMO_SNMP to vtss_appl/include/vtss/appl/vtss_module_id.h.
If you use tags in your editor, then search for VTSS_MODULE_ID_NONE.
You will have to edit 3 places in this file. See the instructions just above
VTSS_MODULE_ID_NONE in this file.

4) Hook up the demo_snmp module with the WebStaX application, i.e., edit
vtss_appl/main/main.c. Search for VTSS_SW_OPTION_HTTPS in that file,
and do something similar, where you just change the HTTPS with DEMO_SNMP.
Three thing must be done:
 a) Include the demo_api.h if VTSS_SW_OPTION_DEMO_SNMP is defined.
 b) Add the demo_init() function to the initfun[] list, if
    VTSS_SW_OPTION_DEMO_SNMP is defined.

5) In the build directory run 'make clobber'. This is because we have
change the make system. And then run 'make -j' or just 'make'.

6) Upload to code to the target.

7) Check that you have a command i ICLI called:
   # demo trap <number>
   If not, you have not hooked up the demo_snmp module as described.

8) Give the target an IP address and try 'http://<TARGET-IP-ADDRESS/VTSS-DEMO-MIB.mib
   which should give you the DEMO SNMP MIB.

9) Goto vtss_appl/demo_snmp/platform/demo_mib.cxx and read the description in the code.
